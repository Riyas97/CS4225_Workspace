Given the increasing vaccine rollup and take-up rate along with the growing evidence about the virus slowly becoming weaker, many governments have become eager to ease the curbs that they once implemented. The motivation is to boost their economies, return to the pre-pandemic normal and as a result improve the lives of their people. However, lifting the restrictions usually causes the cases to rise and more to get severely ill or worse, die. As a result, there are mixed feelings among people whether to ease the restrictions. In the case of Singapore, when the government announced that it will be postponing the streamlined measures in view of the rising cases and the resulting pressure on the healthcare workers, there were again mixed reactions with some applauding the government and the others being disappointed.")

From the start of 2022 onwards, Twitter has 217 million monetizable daily active users and the number of tweets sent per day reaches approximately 500 million. The gigantic number of tweets that are made publicly available every day enables better predictions and more accurate interpretation of the publicâ€™s sentiments around the globe.

The dataset size after hydration can range from 20-50 GB for each-day data (about 2TB data across a two-month period), indicating the need for large storage space and efficient processing power. We also had a decision to make whether to include only English tweets, or to include tweets from other languages. We weighed the pros of both options, where with English tweets we would be able to account for accuracy in tone, while having multiple languages provides more representation of sentiments. In the end, we decided to only include English tweets as we valued the accuracy in our sentiment analysis greater than the representativeness of the sentiments.")

The pandemic has caused a shear negative impact on the economy and peoplesâ€™ livelihoods. Given the increasing vaccine rollup and take-up rate along with the growing evidence about the virus slowly becoming weaker, many governments have become eager to ease the curbs that they once implemented. The motivation is to boost their economies, return to the pre-pandemic normal and as a result improve the lives of their people. However, lifting the restrictions usually causes the cases to rise and more to get severely ill or worse, die. As a result, there are mixed feelings among people whether to ease the restrictions. In the case of Singapore, when the government announced that it will be postponing the streamlined measures in view of the rising cases and the resulting pressure on the healthcare workers, there were again mixed reactions with some applauding the government and the others being disappointed.")

To achieve such a purpose, we would like to make well use of COVID-19 related tweets since Twitter is undoubtedly one of the best platforms to obtain data regarding peopleâ€™s general feelings given that many use it to regularly post their opinions and let their voices be heard. From the start of 2022 onwards, Twitter has 217 million monetizable daily active users and the number of tweets sent per day reaches approximately 500 million. The gigantic number of tweets that are made publicly available every day enables better predictions and more accurate interpretation of the publicâ€™s sentiments around the globe. Moreover, there are plentiful well-established APIs that make it practical to conduct sentiment analysis on these tweets.")
